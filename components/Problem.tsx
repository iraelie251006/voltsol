            In Rwanda, According to National Institute of Statistics of Rwanda(NISR) 41% of people rely on
            bicycles for daily mobility especially in rural areas where traditional bicycles remain limited by
            hilly terrain and long distances, discouraging wider use. This pushes many commuters toward
            motorcycles and old fuel-powered vehicles, which not only increase transport costs but also
            drive rising greenhouse gas emissions, with the transport sector already contributing 13% of
            national emissions. Without accessible electric alternatives, the potential of bicycles as a low-
            cost, eco-friendly transport solution remains underutilized, slowing both sustainable mobility
            and environmental conservation efforts.
